## Multipage Webpack Starter Kit

Setting up Webpack for your new project can be a nightmare. 

This template aims to get you up and running with a best in class setup that covers all the features a modern multipage website needs.

### Out of the box you will get:
- HTML partials and optimisation with EJS templates
- Sass compilation
- Automatic creation of WebP and fallback images
- Optimisation of all images based on format 
- ES6 compilation to all browsers
- Cache busting with file hashes 

### Configuration

Editing the `./config.js` file you may configure your project and define the entry points and bundles for each of the HTML pages you will be building. 

**You should never need to modify the `webpack.babel.js` configuration file directly.**
